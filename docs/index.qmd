# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to our Nextflow workshop for intermediate and advanced users! In this workshop, we will explore the advanced features of the Nextflow language and runtime, and learn how to use them to write efficient and scalable data-intensive workflows. We will cover topics such as parallel execution, error handling, and workflow customization. Please note that this is not an introductory workshop, and we will assume some basic familiarity with Nextflow. By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills and knowledge to create complex and powerful Nextflow pipelines for your own data analysis projects. Let's get started!
